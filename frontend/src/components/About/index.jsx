            Use at your own risk. HD account generators can be dangerous
            if you don't take proper security precautions. This tool can
            be used to restore your Stellar account from previously
            generated mnemonic. We recommend that this functionality
            only be used in case the following are true:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                You need immediate "<em>spend access</em>" to your
                Stellar account

            <li>You are in posession of your 24 word mnemonic</li>
            <li>
                You don't have or can't use your Ledger device at the
                moment

            How does <em>Redshift</em> work?
        </p>
        <p>There are two modes of operation:</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Generate</strong>
            <br />
            24 words mnemonic (256 bits of entropy) is auto generated.
            The mnemonic is used to derive a seed, which serves as a
            basis for generating deterministic Stellar accounts. Each
            mnemonic can be complemented with a passphrase. The
            passphrase can be any UTF-8 string up to 100 characters and
            is "something you know" in addition to "something you have"
            such as your 24 word mnemonic. This prevents the
            perpetrators from gaining access to your account even when
            they get a hold of your mnemonic as they would still need
            your passphrase to restore the account. You can also choose
            to specify the account hierarchy, expressed as a positive
            integer index. 0 is used to generate the default account.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Restore</strong>
            <br />
            If you have already generted your mnemonic phrase in the
            past by using a hardware wallet or this tool, you can
            restore your Stellar account keys by entering the 24 words.
            If you protected your mnemonic with a passphrase you can
            enter it as well. Restoring the account can really be
            thought of as creating the mnemonic by hand. Each word of
            the mnemonic is limited to 100 characters and can be any
            UTF-8 string. You can come up with your own phrase and it
            will still generate a valid Stellar account, however, this
            is <strong>strongly discouraged</strong> as it is not secure
            due to the low level of randomness.

        <p>
            BIP39 mnemonics can be used to generate deterministic series
            of account addresses. The method presented here uses 24
            words to generate series of deterministic Stellar key pairs.
            24 word mnemonics are also used by many hardware wallets
            (such as Ledger Nano S). This tool can also be used to{" "}
            <em>restore</em> your account based on the mnemonic that was
            generated earlier by either the hardware wallet or any other
            wallets compatible with BIP39, BIP32 and BIP44
            specifications. You can find out more and take a look at Ian

            Redshift uses BIP32 path with hardened derivation. You can
            choose to derive key pair for default account (with index
            address equal to 0) or uncheck 'Use Default Account' and
            select index number of desired account hierarchy. The upper
            limit of index number of child accounts is 2<sup>31</sup>.

            Stellar Ecosystem Proposal describes implementation of
            deterministic key derivation for Stellar accounts based on
            word mnemonic of different lengths. Redshift will use 24
            word mnemonics in order to be compatible with Ledger
            devices. Different mnemonic lengths will be implemented in
            the future.
